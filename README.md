# PartyMatch
An app for National Hack the Government 2015. 
It aims to engage teenagers with the upcoming election and help them choose a party based on how party's voted and the users agreement with the bills via a medium that almost all teenagers know and use - Tinder!


Voting data (from The Public Whip) is used to match users answers with the party that votes most in their interest.

Currently a prototype, changes/additions to be made:
- Adding click card to gain information about the current question
- Changing the results from just plain 'You should vote for' to a breakdown of all and why
- Improving questions to provide a better insight into the best party and better relevance to first time voters (our target user)
